# B42 spawn refresh (B42 only)

- Regenerated B42 spawnpoints from `projectzomboidmapping.ods` (`all_loc` -> `Smart Z line creation`), producing 2,688 entries for the full list.
- Updated `Contents/mods/Pillow's Many Spawns Pack/42/media/maps/Many Spawns root/spawnpoints.lua` to use the full dataset (deprecated the legacy “All” variant).
- Filtered rows with `Casual = Yes` to build the 2,580-entry casual list at `Contents/mods/Pillow's Many Spawns Pack/42/media/maps/Many Spawns Casual/spawnpoints.lua`.
- Regenerated all B42 "By Location" spawnpoints by grouping on `Area` (merging Hog Wallow + Doe Valley Forest + Isolated Areas into `Isolated Areas`, normalizing Westpoint to `West Point`). Added new B42 area folders/map.info for Brandenburg, Echo Creek, Irvington, and Isolated Areas.
- Updated Louisville "By Location" count (1,504) and removed the standalone B42 Louisville map in favor of the By Location variant.
- Regenerated B42 "By Profession" spawnpoints from the sheet with these rules (randomly capped where noted): police officer = cat2 police or security; construction worker = note contains construction or cat2 construction; repairman = cat2 factory; security guard = cat2 security or school; park ranger = cat2 remote or category cabin; fire officer = cat2 fire station; chef/burgerflipper = cat2 dining (max 100); doctor/nurse = cat2 medical; carpenter = cat2 factory or construction or note construction; burglar = 90 home + 10 jail (cat2); farmer = category farm (100); fisherman = home in Riverside/West Point/Echo Creek priority plus smaller home sample elsewhere; veteran/fitness instructor = 100 home with Louisville priority; lumberjack = 100 rural; electrician/engineer/metalworker = cat2 factory (100 each); mechanic = all cat2 mechanic plus 50 random others; unemployed = 100 apartment or vacant.
- MP Edition B42 spawnpoints now sample ~12% per Area (minimum 1 per area) from the full list (≈322 spawns, All Reduced) and Knox Reduced applies the same sampling without Louisville (≈142 spawns).
- Variations refreshed: removed Car Wrecks and Hitchhikers entirely; regenerated Patients (68, cat2=medical), Prisoners (20, cat2=jail), Schools (51, cat2=school), Visitors (52, cat2=hotel room), and Building Inspector (104 indoor spawns with posZ≥3) across common/41/42.
- Only variation maps were refreshed in B41 to match the new rules; other B41 content remains untouched.
- Menu/label cleanup: renamed full list to “Random Spawns, Full” and casual to “Random Spawns Casual”; standardized By Location titles to “Random Spawns By Location - <Location>”, removed Industrial Zone and McCoy Logging location entries, and trimmed Ekron title (removed “rural town”). Cleaned an empty West Point folder in Anywhere But; further investigation may be needed if it still fails to appear.
- Removed the duplicate “Full (All)” map entries (Pillow's Many Spawns Pack - All and By Location “Many Spawns All”) since they used the same 2,688 spawns as the main Full list.
